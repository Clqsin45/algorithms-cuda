# Redution algorithms

 two steps reduction, single step reudtion based on  atomic operations and non-atomic operations, and template-based loop expansion.

 The test code has 

There are two versions test code using [thrust](http://thrust.github.io/) and without thrust.

# Usage

```shell
make
./reduction_cuda.exe
./reduction_thrust.exe
```

See [Makefile](Makefile) for detail.
